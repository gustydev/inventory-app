# Inventory App
An app for managing a fictional store's item inventory, made with Express and Node.

This is the MongoDB version. I have also refactored the project to use PostgreSQL in [this branch](https://github.com/gustydev/inventory-app/tree/postgres).

## Features
1. Dynamic page generation based on item and category ID's
2. Model-View-Controller architecture
3. Image uploading to Cloudinary (SaaS service for file hosting)
4. CRUD operations on items and categories in MongoDB
